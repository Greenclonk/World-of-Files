# World-of-Files (Windows)
A small programm in the style of older text adventures. 
Small Editor to create the world files and language files.

You choose a language and a world, and then you explore the world by going to different paths, and seeing the places.

There's only a small Test World "Hyrule" at the moment and "English" language. 

Made on SFML, in the course of a week or two.
Might add some gameplay to it if I ever feel like it. (combat/items/etc)
